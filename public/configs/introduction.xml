  <Markdown source="# Welcome!\n\n## Where am I?\n\nYou are now browsing a web application created with React, which is a part of [my portfolio](https://koroknay.tech). It showcases some of the work I have done on a configurable UI framework. Feel free to browse the various sections using the left-hand menu. If it is not displayed currently, you can bring it up with the menu button in the top left corner.\n\nYou can view the source code of this application at its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mkoro/portfolio-ui).\n\n## What is this application?\n\nIt is a configurable UI framework, albeit a simplified one.\n\nA configurable UI framework means that non-technical people can use it to create UI pages in an application.\n\nIn the case of this demo, it uses an XML-like format to describe and configure the various elements of the UI. If you click on the **Editor** menu option on the left, you will see an example ''source code'' that you can edit yourself and see the effects of your changes in real time.\n\nIf you want to see a pre-configured example of a UI form created with this application, you can visit **Example Form** on the left.\n\n## So, you basically uploaded here a web application that you created earlier?\n\nNo. The application which you find on this site is heavily inspired by work I have done, but it does not re-use any existing code. All code on this page was created from scratch, specifically for the purposes of this portfolio website, and does not share any code, assets, or logic with any real-life application I have been working on.\n    \n## Cool, I can see that I can add new content in the Editor section of this app. Are you saving any of my data?\n\nNo, any data that you enter on this page only exists in your browser, and will disappear if you\nreload the page or close it.\n\n## Can I contact you if I have any questions?\n\nYes, you can write me an e-mail by clicking [here](mailto:m_koro@outlook.com).\n" />
